# Numpy 
<p>
NumPy(Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that's used in almost every field of science and engineering. It's the univrsal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it's at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystem. Numpy users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python Package.

<p>
The NumPy librray contains multidimensional array and matrix data sturctures (you'll find more information about this in later sections). It provides **ndarray**, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathmematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

## Installing Numpy
To install numpy , i recommended using scientific python distribution 
if you already have Python, you can install NumPy with : <br>
```conda install numpy```<br>
or <br>
```pip install numpy```<br>
If you dont have Python yet. you might want to consider using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). It's the easiest way to get started. The good thing about getting this distribution is the fact that you don't need to worry too much about seperately installing NumPy or any of the major package that you'll be using for your data analyses, like pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.

## How to import NumPy
To access NumPy and its functions import it in your Python code like this : 
```import numpy as np``` <br>
We shorten the imported name to `np` for better of code using NumPy. This is a widely adopted convention that makes your code more readable for everyone working ot it. We recommend to always use import numpy as `np`,
