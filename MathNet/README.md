# MathNet
Math.NET Numerics aims to provide methods and algorithms for numerical computations in science, engineering and everyday
use. Covered topics include special functions, linear algebra, probability models, random numbers, interpolation
integration, regression, optimization problems and more

Math.NET Numerics is part of the [Math.NET initiative](https://www.mathdotnet.com/) and is the result of merging dn Analytics with Math.NET iridium,
replacing both, Available for free under the [MIT License](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/License). It targets Microsoft .NET 5.0, .NET 4.6.1 and higher, and .NET Standard 2.0 and higher. In addition to a purely managed implementation 
it also supports native hardware optimization. You can See [Platform Support](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/Compatibility) for full details

## NuGet Packages

* [MathNet.Numerics](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MathNet.Numerics/) - core package
* [MathNet.NumericsFSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MathNet.Numerics.FSharp/) - optional extensions for a better experience
when using F#

See [NuGet & Binaries](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/Packages) for a complete list of our NuGet packages, Zip Files and release archive

# using Math.NET Numerics with C#
Being written in it, Math.NET Numerics works very well with C# and related .NET language. When using Visual Studio or another IDE with built-in NuGet Support, you can get started quickly by adding a reference to the **MathNet.Numerics** NuGet package. Alternatively you can grab that package with the command line tool with **nuget.exe install MathNet.Numerics -Pre** or simply dowload the Zip Package.
